# Petroleum_systems_models
This document is an outline of the models provided, with a brief description of each one.

Standard soure rock conditions are used in all models. All models hava a sampling size of 400 m by 400 m unless specified otherwise.
Model names starting with 'Bridport' do not include Sherwood reservoir injection and are used to identify Bridport migration pathways.
Model names beginning with 'Sherwood' have injected oil in the Sherwood reservoir and are used to identify Sherwood migration pathways.


Standard = Standard source rock conditions. Purbeck Fault is closed throughout
Standard_sampling_2 = Same as above but at a sampling of 200 m by 200 m.


Bridport_1200_no_faults = No faults included. 1200 m of Late Cretaceous deposition. This model was also run using the combined IP-DF method and at a higher and lower Bridport reservoir porosity. Models have also been run where Wytch Farm faults are not included and Purbeck faults are open during the Cretaceous and closed in the Cenozoic.
Bridport_1200_no_faults_13Ma_PWD = No faults included. 1200 m of Late Cretaceous deposition. Tilt angle increased to 1 degree at 13 Ma using paleo-water depth (PWD).
Bridport_1200_no_faults_2Ma_PWD = No faults included. 1200 m of Late Cretaceous deposition. Tilt angle increased to 1 degree at 2 Ma using PWD.
Bridport_900_no faults = No faults included. 900 m of Late Cretaceous deposition.
Bridport_900_open =  All faults open except Purbeck Fault which closes in the Cenozoic. 900 m of Late Cretaceous deposition. This model was also run using the combined IP-DF method. A model has also been run where the Purbeck Fault also remains open in the Cenozoic. 
Bridport_900_closed = All faults closed. Purbeck Fault remains open until Cenozoic. 900 m of Late Cretaceous deposition. This model was also run using the combined IP-DF method. A model has also been run where all models are open in the Cretaceous and closed in the Cenozoic.


Sherwood injected near Creech, east of Bushey Farm and offshore. Each injection site has injection amount of 0.113 Gtons (total 0.34 Gtons equivalent to 2.48 Bbbls).


Sherwood_no_faults =  No Wytch Farm faults, Purbeck Fault closes in Cenozoic. This model was also run using the a higher total injection amount of 0.6 Gtons (4.38 Bbbls) and at a higher and lower Sherwood reservoir porosity.
Sherwood_no_faults_sampling_2 = same as above but at a sampling of 200 m by 200 m.
Sherwood_open = Wytch Farm faults open, Purbeck Fault closes in Cenozoic. This model has also been run at a 13Ma 1 degree tilt angle using PWD values from model Sherwood_none_13Ma_PWD.
Sherwood_closed = Wytch Farm faults closed, Purbeck Fault closed in Cenozoic.   
Sherwood_none_13Ma_PWD = No faults included. Tilt angle increased to 1 degree at 13 Ma using PWD. This model was also run using the a higher injection amount of 600 Gtons.
Sherwood_none_2Ma_PWD = No faults included. Tilt angle increased to 1 degree at 2 Ma using PWD.
